## Title:


## Idea/Problem Statement:
>  To create an idea and thought sharing platform for a community.
## Category:
> Web Application

## Background:
   
   An individual can have a lot of ideas and eventually might fail to execute them due to various reasons. One such reason would be lack of people who really can contribute to his work and make it worthy or make it popular.
   
   For Instance, There might be a guy who is really interested in film making and wants to make a short film in such a scenario he might need a crew with similar interests or work experiences in the same community(university).
   So, it would be great if we have a platform where one can expose a small gist of their ideas and find people who really can contribute to his/her ideas and bring them to life.
   
   Basically, the idea can potentially be anything like an AI project or a short film or writing a book and so on. 
		
   Moreover, this is focused on promoting new ideas and creating their own space to work together(like goals), giving room to write their own experiences regarding projects they have worked on or any achievements they have made so far.

   Alongside, people can also hang out on the platform by posting memories, polls, confessions. They can have a great time here meeting new people and share innovative ideas to build something worthy!! 
   
> **The whole idea of this application revolves around finding collaborators for the ideas of an individual.**
## Features

* Users will be able to create an account and personalize his\her profile.
* Since the idea of the application revolves around the community, one has to create his/her own profile and will be able to make friends.
* User will be able to register or login to the site and customize his profile, **(Authentication and profile creation and modification)** make friends and of course post ideas, blogs, confessions, polls, and so on.
* As the app is mainly focused on sharing ideas and attract collaborators, we will be building an interface where the user will be able to express(enter) their content(ideas and blogs) in markdown format and will be able to preview the changes in realtime and share the same content with the community. **(Post Content - The Markdown Editor)**
* As part of the community, they can express their thoughts, confessions and conduct polls on various aspects. **(Post Content)** 
* Users will receive posts according to their interests **(Post Recommendation Algorithm)**.
* User will be able to react and comment on other people's content, the people who he/she follows **(Responding to other's content)**. 
* User can form a workspace for people who reacted to his idea potentially these are the people whom the user feels are worthy enough for contributing to his/her idea.**(Collaborator clustering and evaluation, WorkSpace Creation)**
* The evaluation of collaborators is based on the responses of the form given by the idea holder. **(Collaborator Evaluation)**
* The main features of the workspace are group chats, creating notes, assigning tasks to the members of the workspace, and so on. **(Collaborator Clustering and Workspace Creation)**
