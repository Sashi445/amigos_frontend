## Title/Problem-Statement
  To create an idea and thought sharing platform for a community.

## Background:
   An individual can have a lot of ideas and eventually might fail to execute them due to various reasons. One such reason would be lack of people who really can contribute to his work and make it worthy or make it popular.
   For Instance, There might be a guy who is really interested in film making and wants to make a short film in such a scenario he might need a crew with similar interests or work experiences in the same community(university).
   So, it would be great if we have a platform where one can expose a small gist of their ideas and find people who really can contribute to his/her ideas and bring them to life.
   
   Basically, the idea can potentially be anything like an AI project or a short film or writing a book and so on. 
		
   Moreover, this is focused on promoting new ideas and creating their own space to work together(like goals), giving room to write their own experiences regarding placements work and projects and creative idea polls.
   Along with these things for making people involved into this and  wide spread the innovative ideas among masses in the community through introducing feed where all the polls,posts,etc will be displayed.
   
   **The whole idea of this application revolves around finding collaborators for the ideas of an individual.**
